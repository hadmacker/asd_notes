# What is Autism?

##### [This section has been augmented with the use of AI](AI.md)

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), also commonly referred to as Autism Spectrum Condition (ASC), is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by a broad range of challenges related to social interaction, communication, and repetitive or restrictive behaviors. Individuals on the autism spectrum may display a diverse array of strengths, abilities, and differences in how they perceive and interact with the world. 

ASD is considered a spectrum because it manifests in varying degrees and with unique characteristics for everyone. The condition typically emerges in early childhood, and its impact can range from mild to severe, influencing how individuals engage with others, communicate, and navigate their surroundings. It is essential to recognize and respect the diversity within the autism spectrum, as each person's experience is unique, requiring tailored approaches to support and understanding.

> “Neurodevelopmental” means that Autism is a _physical difference_ in the brain. It goes beyond simply “thinking differently” than others.

>  In her book, “The Autistic Brain”, _Dr. Temple Grandin_ goes deep into analysis of the differences in the autistic brain, including comparison of her own unique brain CT scans compared to a “typical” brain.

# The History of Autism

##### [This section has been augmented with the use of AI](AI.md)

The history of autism spans several decades and has evolved significantly, marked by key milestones, and shifts in understanding. Here is a brief overview:

1. Early Observations:
In the early 20th century, there were anecdotal accounts of individuals who displayed characteristics now associated with autism, but the condition was not formally identified.

2. Leo Kanner's Contribution (1943):
[Dr. Leo Kanner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Kanner), an Austrian-American psychiatrist, is credited with providing the first systematic description of autism. In 1943, he published a groundbreaking paper titled "Autistic Disturbances of Affective Contact," where he outlined the characteristics of 11 children who exhibited social and communicative challenges.

3. [Hans Asperger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Asperger)'s Contribution (1944):
Concurrently, Hans Asperger, an Austrian pediatrician, described a milder form of autism that came to be known as Asperger's syndrome. Asperger's work, however, gained recognition later than Kanner's.
Asperger’s research identified that some forms of Autism manifested with a paradox of gifts and deficits.

4. Evolution of Terminology:
Throughout the mid-20th century, the terminology used to describe the condition evolved. Terms like "early infantile autism" and "childhood schizophrenia" were employed, reflecting the evolving understanding of these conditions.

5. Broadening Definitions:
In the 1970s and 1980s, the definition of autism broadened to include a spectrum of disorders, recognizing that individuals could present with a range of symptoms and severity.

6. DSM-III (1980):
The third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III) in 1980 officially categorized autism as a distinct diagnostic category, separating it from schizophrenia.

7. DSM-IV (1994):
The DSM-IV, published in 1994, further refined diagnostic criteria and introduced the term "Pervasive Developmental Disorders" to encompass a spectrum that included autistic disorder, Asperger's disorder, and others.

8. DSM-5 (2013):
The most recent edition of the DSM, the DSM-5, published in 2013, consolidated various subcategories into a single umbrella term: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). This change aimed to reflect the recognition that the distinctions between different subtypes were not always clear-cut, and that ASD exists on a continuum.

Over the decades, our understanding of autism has grown from early observations to a more nuanced appreciation of the spectrum. The contributions of Kanner and Asperger were foundational, and subsequent research and clinical observations have expanded our knowledge, emphasizing the heterogeneity of the condition. The shift towards a spectrum perspective in the DSM-5 reflects a more contemporary and inclusive understanding of autism, allowing for a more comprehensive and person-centered approach to diagnosis and care.
