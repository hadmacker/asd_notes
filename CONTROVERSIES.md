# Controversies

* [Wiki: Controversies in Autism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversies_in_autism)
* Judge Rotenberg Educational Center [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judge_Rotenberg_Educational_Center)
  * Controversy over its use of aversives in the form of electric shock punishment.
  * [2018, Massachusetts school can continue using electric shocks on special needs students, judge rules](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/electric-shock-therapy-school-special-needs-children-massachusetts-judge-rotenberg-center-canton-a8429736.html)

    > Some schools use **restraint and seclusion** on people with disabilities. Some use **aversives**. All three are very dangerous!
* Autism Speaks Controversies 
  * Multiple controversies from inaccurate statistics, views of Autism as a disease to be cured, a focus on the effects of Autism to the family and not on the individual, and a lack of representation of Neurodivergent individuals on their board. 
  * Autism Speaks has recognized some of their past views and actions were harmful. [Autism Speaks "For the Record" FAQ](https://www.autismspeaks.ca/for-the-record/)
  * [Wiki: Autism Speaks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism_Speaks)
  * [ASAN: Before you donate to Autism Speaks, Consider the facts](https://autisticadvocacy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/AutismSpeaksFlyer2020.pdf)
  * The grouping of disorders that are classified as Autism in DSM-5 has changed significantly, and [Autism Speaks "For the Record" FAQ](https://www.autismspeaks.ca/for-the-record/) clearly compares 2005 (DSM-4) to 2016+ (DDSM-5) diagnosis rate statistics crossing different diagnostic criteria, not explaining the the grouping as a significant factor contributing to an increase in Autism diagnosis statistics. Comparison of statistics derived using different diagnostic criteria is reckless and misleading.
* Vaccines and Autism
  * Andrew Wakefield [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Wakefield), was responsible for the [1998 Lancet MMR Autism Fraud, Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancet_MMR_autism_fraud) spreading false rumors associating vaccines to autism.
