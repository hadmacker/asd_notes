# Accommodations

[Accommodations for Autism: 21 Best Recommendations for Learning](https://thehomeschoolresourceroom.com/2021/04/12/accommodations-autism/)

* Additional breaks
* Additional time to complete tasks
* Allow verbal answers on tests, quizzes, open ended questions (instead of written answers)
* Excused from class or work
* Isolation when taking exams
* No Sarcasm
* Provide written transcriptions/copies of lectures and discussion
* Quiet or sensory-safe rooms
* Tutors, extra learing
* (In the remote world) Allowed to disable video in chat or mute.
* For faster transition between class, allow the child to bring their backpack to class (instead of asking them to use their locker) and tape a schedule and list of materials for each class to a binder.
* For children that monopolize the teacher's time with questions, they may require 100% of details to process information. This may diminish the classes rigor and flow, driving attention away from other children in class. Allow them to ask a certain number of questions as determined by a number of poker chips in front of them. As they ask questions, tokens are removed, to be replenished at the teacher's discretion. Once questions have been removed, they should be instructed to write their questions in a notebook or to see the teacher during downtime.
* Request a mock bus ride, possibly around the neighborhood, to be conditioned to being on a bus.
* provide a notebook and pen of travels from home to school daily teachers and therapist should be expected to document attempted tasks having challenges and send instructions home on how to reinforce skills desired, and then return the notebook back to school with comments, and how she felt in the home environment doing the same things
* Potentially continue schooling through summer break to reduce regression of skills that may atrophy if unused during the summer break.

# IEP (Individualized Education Program)

> If they can't learn the way we teach, we teach the way they learn.  
> Dr. Ivar Lovaas, creator of ABA Therapy.  

> I've come to a frightening conclusion that I [as the teacher] am the decisive element in the classroom.  
> Haim Ginott, highly regarded educator and author  

> Because I think differently, my autism requires that you teach differently. In order to teach me to color inside the lines, you may have to reach outside those lines. To get me to see life and learning as a palette of colors, you have to start by understanding that through my eyes, life's experiences are black and white, all or nothing.

* **Presume competence.** Presume that your child is aware and wants to understand. Consider that this might look different than what you expect. (Lei Wiley-Mydske)
  * The above is confirmed by the presense of books including:
    * [The Reason I Jump, Naoki Higashida](https://www.amazon.ca/Reason-Jump-Inner-Thirteen-Year-Old-Autism/dp/0345807820)
    * [I have been buried under years of dust, Valerie Gilpeer & Emily Grodin](https://www.amazon.ca/Have-Been-Buried-Under-Years/dp/0062984349)
* **Hidden curriculum**: the unwritten, unofficial, and often unintended lessons values and perspectives that students learn in school.
* Keep a photo of child available for IEP and diagnostic consultations for when the child is not present, to remind professionals of the humanity of the individual being discussed. Source: [Uniquely Human](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/23492643)
* Philosophy
  * Students should get what they need to succeed. Because they need it.
  * A three-legged stool analogy may be beneficial here. There must be balance on all sides for our child to sit on top.
* Parents, educators, professionals share the same table, even if they're often on opposite sides. While this may appear intimidating to parents, **the shared goal of all parties is to maximize the child's educational experience and potential**. Each role around the table is essential to maximize this goal:
  * **Parents**: Know the full child and their strengths, weaknesses, and patterns of behaviour outside of school time.
  * **Educators**: Execute the IEP agreed upon.
  * **Professionals**: Bring expertise, insight, tools, strategies and pragmatics to the discussion.
* Questions to ask:
  * What therapy services are provided? OT (Occupational Therapy), PT (Physical Therapy), ST (Speach Therapy), others?
  * Does the school system have an autism consultant or coordinator? How can parents access this resources?
  * What is the class size and ratio of students to teachers and assistants?
  * What evidence-based teaching practices are utilized?
  * Does this child's teacher have experience teaching children with autism?
  * Do they have any special education licensure?
  * How do the staff handle behaviour issues?
  * How do we succeed as a team? How can I help you to be successful? How can I volunteer?
* Tools:
  * Parents can include a log book in the child's backpack that follows the child to/from school for teachers to document any teaching that the child struggled with during the day and with further instruction that the parents can support from home, or for teachers or support staff to write little notes about the skills worked on and that the family may be able to reinforce from home.
  * Create a personalized story or picture schedule for the child's school day. Contact the teacher or school to access their daily schedule. A picture of the teacher or classroom may also help to set the story narrative.
  * If the child is a bus rider, find the bus number. Request a "mock bus ride" if the school division offers one.
