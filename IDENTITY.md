# Personal Notes

:warning: While I try to maintain a neutral set of resources pertaining to Autism in these pages, I felt it was relevant to include elements of a recent conversation on autism and identity below.

Identify first vs person first is an individual decision, and in all my reading in books and forums, it continues to be a contentious topic with strong opinions on both sides, even within the autism community.

My research suggests those that are “higher functioning” or “level 1” may prefer to use identity first (he’s autistic) instead of person-first “with/has autism” because the latter is also used more frequently to refer to disease. (Has cancer, for example). 

My personal thought on why this is an unresolved matter around identity vs. Person first views differ in whether individuals see autism as a Condition vs. Disorder, and may be relevant  whether the individual identifies more with the research done by Hans Asperger compared to the research done by Leo Kanner. Identity-first language may be related to associating their autism with special gifts, or that all aspects of an individual's life is framed through the lens of autism.

Parents, care providers, and individuals touched by an autism diagnosis should evaluate for themselves how they prefer to identify with autism.
