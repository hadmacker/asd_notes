<div style="position:absolute;top:511;left:135"><nobr>The Environment</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:553;left:135"><nobr>In 1963, when I entered the College of Engineering at Berkeley as a freshman, the world</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:573;left:135"><nobr>was a much different place from today, especially for an 18-year-old acolyte entering the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:594;left:135"><nobr>priesthood of technology. Engineers and other technologists were almost universally</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:615;left:135"><nobr>participants in large commercial or military institutions (or both – the “military industrial</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:635;left:135"><nobr>complex” described by Eisenhower in his farewell address). You worked as a small cog</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:656;left:135"><nobr>within a massive structure, with paper, pencil and slide rule as your principal tools.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:677;left:135"><nobr>Numerous file clerks, documentation clerks, secretaries and technicians provided</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:697;left:135"><nobr>supporting services. If you needed computer time you had to write a justification and then</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:718;left:135"><nobr>write your program on coding sheets, one letter or number to a square. Someone else</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:739;left:135"><nobr>keypunched the code and had the resulting deck of cards delivered to a remote computer.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:760;left:135"><nobr>You got back a batch of printout over which you pored until you decided whether the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:780;left:135"><nobr>results were correct or whether another cycle would necessary.  The upshot was that in</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:801;left:135"><nobr>your vocation you disappeared into a vast technological machine which was visible to the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:822;left:135"><nobr>general public through its products – the space program, pharmaceuticals, automobiles</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:842;left:135"><nobr>and aircraft. The public relations machine of the institutions for which you worked</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:863;left:135"><nobr>extolled the products as the inevitable triumphs of administrative vision. Whatever</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:884;left:135"><nobr>resulted was described as the inevitable result of “progress”, against which resistance was</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:904;left:135"><nobr>understood to be futile. No alternate outcomes could be posited. </nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:946;left:135"><nobr>The few published critics of technology, such as Lewis Mumford, C. P. Snow and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:967;left:135"><nobr>Norbert Wiener, spoke mostly to academic audiences in their writings. They provided the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:987;left:135"><nobr>only conduits through which any of the reality experienced by engineers was made</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:1008;left:135"><nobr>known to intellectual opinion leaders. These works all seem to be written from the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:1029;left:135"><nobr>outside looking in – attempts to interpret something called “science” and people called</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:1049;left:135"><nobr>“scientists” to a literate, intellectual populace who for all their presumed erudition could</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:1070;left:135"><nobr>not distinguish between scientists and technological workers like engineers. I recall some</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:1091;left:135"><nobr>conversations with an aunt of mine, a medical practitioner who religiously read the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:1111;left:135"><nobr>Saturday Review, which made it clear to me that she understood “engineer” to mean a</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:1132;left:135"><nobr>maintenance worker like those at her hospital who held that title.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:1174;left:135"><nobr>It is my contention that American culture has long held technology to be its secular</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:1194;left:135"><nobr>religion – thus the reference to “acolytes” and “priesthood” above. Often in conversation</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:1215;left:135"><nobr>with people in Berkeley I experienced them recoiling when the conversation turned to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:1236;left:135"><nobr>“what I do”. “Oh, I could never understand things like that”, they would say while </nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:1475;left:135"><nobr>closing down utterly to my attempts to explain. I eventually came to understand that they</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:1495;left:135"><nobr>perceived that I was flaunting my presumed intellectual achievements, when in fact I had</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:1516;left:135"><nobr>done no such thing and was trying to connect with them on an accessible level. Priests</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:1537;left:135"><nobr>and parishioners are supposed to maintain a distance in order to validate the relationship. </nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:1578;left:135"><nobr>On a Different Plane</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:1620;left:135"><nobr>As part of the relationship priests are not held accountable for the consequences of their</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:1641;left:135"><nobr>actions. When I participated in the planning of Stop the Draft Week in October of 1967, I</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:1661;left:135"><nobr>was explicit in not participating in the political discussion within the small Steering</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:1682;left:135"><nobr>Committee (the totality of the organization, counting among its members several names</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:1702;left:135"><nobr>recognizable to people who followed radical activity in Berkeley and San Francisco at the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:1723;left:135"><nobr>time). “I’m a technician” I would say, “you can discuss politics; I’ll work on</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:1744;left:135"><nobr>implementing the decisions you make”. </nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:1785;left:135"><nobr>The actions organized by this group yielded the first antiwar demonstrations that could</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:1806;left:135"><nobr>seriously be called a riot; with the streets around the Oakland Army Induction Center</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:1827;left:135"><nobr>occupied by hundreds of protestors who re-painted traffic signs with antiwar slogans and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:1848;left:135"><nobr>baited the police (providing boxes of spray cans was a brilliant idea for which others bear</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:1868;left:135"><nobr>credit). The result was a conspiracy trial of seven of the steering committee’s members,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:1889;left:135"><nobr>including Frank Bardacke, a highly visible campus radical who joined at the last minute</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:1909;left:135"><nobr>and who, like me, refused to engage in any decision making. The case was named after</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:1930;left:135"><nobr>him and I was not one of the indictees.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:1972;left:135"><nobr>During the course of the trial much of the testimony referred to things I had done, or so I</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:1992;left:135"><nobr>was told. The trial resulted in an acquittal, obviating the necessity of transcribing the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:2013;left:135"><nobr>stenographer’s notes, so I do not have a written record of the testimony. During</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:2034;left:135"><nobr>summation, one of the defense attorneys argued that “they shouldn’t have indicted these</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:2055;left:135"><nobr>young men – they should have indicted Lee Felsenstein!”  (The acquittal was based upon</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:2075;left:135"><nobr>a strong antiwar defense and cannot be credited to this alibi).</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:2116;left:135"><nobr>I had been very visible to the authorities during the planning process, taunting police</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:2137;left:135"><nobr>photographers as they attempted surreptitiously to photograph us scouting locations and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:2158;left:135"><nobr>dealing directly with undercover infiltrators of our radio squads. But when it came time</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:2179;left:135"><nobr>for the political authorities to name those against whom their wrath would be directed I</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:2199;left:135"><nobr>was invisible, as if my dimensions were smaller than their sensory organs could detect.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:2220;left:135"><nobr>Others with higher visibility were brought to trial, but not me.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:2262;left:135"><nobr>I realized from this experience that as a technologist I was not seen as a political actor in</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:2282;left:135"><nobr>any sense, at least by the empowered political actors of the society.  They inhabited a</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:2303;left:135"><nobr>domain that was separated from my domain by a third domain – that of business. Political</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:2323;left:135"><nobr>actors made decisions regarding “policy” that resulted in money being directed to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:2344;left:135"><nobr>different sectors of the business structure. Those who acted in the business sphere would</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:2365;left:135"><nobr>direct technical actors as to what results they were willing to fund, and the work would</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:2386;left:135"><nobr>commence. </nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:2663;left:135"><nobr>The idea that technologists could function as citizens in directing their own efforts,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:2683;left:135"><nobr>individually or collectively, toward desired ends other than enrichment of business</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:2704;left:135"><nobr>owners was totally foreign to political thinkers, both within and in opposition to the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:2725;left:135"><nobr>established power structure. </nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:2766;left:135"><nobr>Computer Power to the People</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:2808;left:135"><nobr>This was a direct outcome of the capital-intensive nature of technology. In the wake of</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:2829;left:135"><nobr>the ‘60’s a few efforts started to at least provide access to computer technology directly</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:2849;left:135"><nobr>to people without the intermediation of commercial or academic institutions. In 1971 I</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:2870;left:135"><nobr>joined a group of former computer science students who were working to acquire and run</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:2890;left:135"><nobr>a time-sharing computer system as a kind of coordinating service for a wide range of</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:2911;left:135"><nobr>grassroots and non-profit activities in the San Francisco area. Led by a driven young</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:2932;left:135"><nobr>woman named Pam Hardt, the group actually succeeded in securing control over a state-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:2953;left:135"><nobr>of-the-art timesharing mainframe computer, setting it up and bringing it to functionality</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:2973;left:135"><nobr>(I was involved in the hardware maintenance). </nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:3015;left:135"><nobr>The technical demands of this computer were so great that heroic efforts were required.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:3036;left:135"><nobr>Large-scale electrical wiring had to be installed to provide three-phase industrial power.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:3056;left:135"><nobr>A large air conditioning system had to be set up to exhaust the heat generated by so much</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:3077;left:135"><nobr>power. A room had to be constructed (with windows as an attempt at accessibility, or at</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:3097;left:135"><nobr>least demystification) in which the computer could run without being disturbed. Many</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:3118;left:135"><nobr>technical obstacles were overcome with much help from computer hardware and software</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:3139;left:135"><nobr>experts at Stanford, UC Berkeley, and Xerox Palo Alto Research Center. </nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:3180;left:135"><nobr>The computer, run by a nonprofit organization called Resource One, Inc., served as a</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:3201;left:135"><nobr>development and test bed for a public-access community information network, but</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:3222;left:135"><nobr>otherwise was little used, partly due to the expense of renting terminals so others could</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:3243;left:135"><nobr>use the system. In retrospect, I came to understand that the lesson of this effort was that</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:3263;left:135"><nobr>attempting to take control of older computers for use by broader userships was a <i>bad</i></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:3284;left:135"><nobr><i>idea</i>. In fact, the expense of obtaining and maintaining terminals and modems drove me</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:3304;left:135"><nobr>to design versions of them that were more amenable to use by ordinary people.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:3346;left:135"><nobr>As the Twig is Bent</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:3387;left:135"><nobr>I remember saying to myself, as I first walked through the crush of humanity that was</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:3408;left:135"><nobr>class change at Sproul Plaza, “Now I can disappear”. This was my state of mind at age</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:3429;left:135"><nobr>18, having grown up rather thoroughly intimidated by my parents, an older brother, and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:3450;left:135"><nobr>an adoptive sister who, as I saw it, displaced me at age two. My major piece of guidance</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:3470;left:135"><nobr>from my mother was to emulate her father, William T. Price, who in 1915 patented an</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:3491;left:135"><nobr>important improvement to diesel engines that made him wealthy, and in 1920 died from</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:3511;left:135"><nobr>medical malpractice, a god in his 5-year-old daughter’s eyes. I was to become an</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:3532;left:135"><nobr>inventor, and have patents. </nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:3574;left:135"><nobr>My brother was three years older and was charged with making sure I stayed out of</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:3594;left:135"><nobr>trouble. He has since become a famous professor. Knowledge and science were the </nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:3871;left:135"><nobr>new and based upon science was good, except when its implementation was “phony” –</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:3892;left:135"><nobr>commercialized, cheapened, for effect rather than function. The Bauhaus motto: “form</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:4017;left:135"><nobr>particularly supported. My father did locate a pile of used radio and television chassis and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:4037;left:135"><nobr>drove me over to the pile several times to replenish my stock of junk. He had been a</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:4058;left:135"><nobr>machinist during World War II, and his toolbox rusted away in the basement. For a</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:4078;left:135"><nobr>birthday he built me a small wooden workbench, but never gave me more than cursory</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:4099;left:135"><nobr>instruction in mechanics or shop practice. </nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:4141;left:135"><nobr>My father’s connections did help, in the form of a correspondence course in radio and</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:4182;left:135"><nobr>of a friend of my father. At age 12 I would flaunt the instructional booklets at school,</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:4410;left:135"><nobr>breakthrough, but he agreed I should be the nominal entrant in the Delaware Valley</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:4431;left:135"><nobr>Science Fair, where it won a third division award, the lowest possible (this was 1958, and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:4451;left:135"><nobr>satellites were the big news with the upset triumph of Sputnik).  </nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:4492;left:135"><nobr>I sat back and awaited my fame. Nothing happened. Indeed, I was feted at school, where I</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:4513;left:135"><nobr>didn’t know how to accept acclaim, but the press never came near. I opened my copy of</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:4534;left:135"><nobr>“Junior Scholastic” – a weekly news magazine for middle-school students and found an</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:4555;left:135"><nobr>article about a model satellite which had been constructed by a boy in – Ohio. It didn’t</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:4575;left:135"><nobr>work, but it contained “real electronic components”. I was outraged. “You’re only as</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:4596;left:135"><nobr>good as your press agent!” was my cynical distillation of the situation. The whole point,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:4617;left:135"><nobr>in my view, was to gain acclaim which would raise my status in the eyes of my parents so</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:4638;left:135"><nobr>that I would not be rejected and abandoned. I entered the science fair every year thorough</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:4658;left:135"><nobr>high school, but never won anything. </nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:4699;left:135"><nobr>I had chosen electronics because the family had a high-school chemistry book which</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:4720;left:135"><nobr>attracted my interest. In it I read that chemists had to know a lot of mathematics, so I put</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:4741;left:135"><nobr>it down in disappointment – I was having trouble with percentages in elementary school</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:4762;left:135"><nobr>at the time. My brother had been given a kit for making a crystal radio, but was not</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:4782;left:135"><nobr>interested (as he much later told me) so I picked it up and managed to get it to work.  </nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:5059;left:135"><nobr>The technology of electronics promised something I apparently wanted greatly –</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:5080;left:135"><nobr>communication outside the hierarchical structure of the family. I dreamed of having a</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:5101;left:135"><nobr>radio amateur’s license – but never managed to team up with anyone to learn the Morse</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:5122;left:135"><nobr>code. I wanted communication at a distance, not close up where people were frightening.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:5142;left:135"><nobr>To this day I wonder how I might have developed had I a mentor and teacher. I’ll never</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:5163;left:135"><nobr>know, but gradually, over the decades, I became more and more that very mentor, both to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:5184;left:135"><nobr>myself and to others.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:5225;left:135"><nobr>Physiological Aspects</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:5266;left:135"><nobr>At this point it is necessary to bring up the aspect of autism, or more specifically, that</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:5287;left:135"><nobr>“high functioning” sort of autism named Asperger’s Syndrome. I knew nothing of it until</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:5308;left:135"><nobr>a few years ago, when a national article on it was published. At almost the same time a</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:5329;left:135"><nobr>cousin of mine visited and explained that he had recently been diagnosed with that</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:5349;left:135"><nobr>condition. He was always an odd one, we all knew, and this started me to thinking about</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:5370;left:135"><nobr>other relatives who might have displayed symptoms. My aunt Carolyn on my mother’s</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:5391;left:135"><nobr>side, the mother of this cousin, was a brilliant woman who rose to be the preeminent book</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:5412;left:135"><nobr>restorer in New York City and the savior of many of the books of Florence from the 1966</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:5432;left:135"><nobr>flood there (she had the idea of freeze-drying the wet and moldering books). However,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:5453;left:135"><nobr>she was always somewhat withdrawn and related to us through a clearly artificial façade</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:5473;left:135"><nobr>of voice and intonation. Her father – my grandfather the inventor – was likewise odd and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:5494;left:135"><nobr>a biographical sketch of him commented on his “lecturing in short pants” – not out of line</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:5515;left:135"><nobr>with a condition which has been nicknamed “little professor syndrome”. </nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:5556;left:135"><nobr>The current thinking on Asperger’s is that it exists on one end of a continuum having</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:5577;left:135"><nobr>classical autism on the other end. If it is a continuum, how far does it extend toward</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:5598;left:135"><nobr>“normal” behavior? No one claims to know, but I suspect that I inhabit a position close</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:5619;left:135"><nobr>to, but not exactly at, the “normal” point. I am a visual thinker, a condition which gives</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:5639;left:135"><nobr>the title to one of the few books on autism written by an autistic person, one Temple</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:5660;left:135"><nobr>Grandin, PhD (“Thinking in Pictures”). I have definite obsessive/compulsive tendencies,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:5680;left:135"><nobr>considering repetitive behavior to be a form of entertainment. It was always difficult for</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:5701;left:135"><nobr>me to understand human behavioral conventions - until being set straight at age 21 I felt</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:5722;left:135"><nobr>intruded upon when someone asked “how are you?” – I thought it was an actual question</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:5743;left:135"><nobr>demanding a rather personal answer. In kindergarten, during recess I would take a ball</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:5763;left:135"><nobr>and walk to the farthest removed corner of the yard, stand a few feet from the wall and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:5784;left:135"><nobr>throw the ball, let it bounce one and catch it, then repeat, for the whole period. People</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:5805;left:135"><nobr>were threatening, I had concluded, though I was still able to function among them. </nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:5846;left:135"><nobr>Asperger’s is not an illness, and can be managed by training. My cousin could never keep</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:5867;left:135"><nobr>a job because he would tell his supervisors exactly what he thought, and this often got</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:5887;left:135"><nobr>him fired. I now think that I am lucky to be affected as much as I am with this condition,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:5908;left:135"><nobr>as it provides me with a basis for a kind of concentration and visualization that has served</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:5929;left:135"><nobr>me well. I am a good extemporaneous speaker to crowds, though I am more awkward and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:5950;left:135"><nobr>reserved in face-to-face discussion.  </nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:6227;left:135"><nobr>New at Berkeley</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:6268;left:135"><nobr>This is now, and that was then. At age eighteen I boarded the train for Berkeley with a</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:6289;left:135"><nobr>$1600 cashier’s check in my suit pocket (it was 1963 and respectable men wore suits</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:6310;left:135"><nobr>then), $600 of which was my own savings from a job after high school and the balance</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:6330;left:135"><nobr>from my father. I was met in San Francisco by my uncle, and next day under my aunt’s</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:6351;left:135"><nobr>supervision had bought a bicycle and was installed in a rented room rather far and uphill</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:6372;left:135"><nobr>from the Berkeley campus. That’s when I told myself that my opportunity was to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:6393;left:135"><nobr>disappear into the horde of humanity that populated the campus. </nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:6434;left:135"><nobr>At Berkeley, just because of the quantity of students, the fraction who were attracted to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:6454;left:135"><nobr>radical political activity was a fair number. There was a history, also, enumerated in some</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:6475;left:135"><nobr>books (“Student” by David Horowitz – who later recanted everything he had done – was</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:6496;left:135"><nobr>one I read while waiting in the registration lines) and I had become particularly interested</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:6517;left:135"><nobr>in Berkeley by reading “The True Bohemia” about the San Francisco Beat scene. I was of</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:6537;left:135"><nobr>radical lineage - my parents were active members of the Communist Party until they were</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:6558;left:135"><nobr>ejected (one charge was “humanitarianism”) around 1955. At that point the clandestine</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:6579;left:135"><nobr>copy of the Daily Worker at home was replaced by the National Guardian, a radical</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:6600;left:135"><nobr>independent paper. Many of my brother’s friends’ parents knew our parents, and as a tag-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:6620;left:135"><nobr>along their crowd was the only one I had to run with. There was an organization of this</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:6641;left:135"><nobr>group, “Teens Ahead” with which I participated in a national march on Washington for</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:6661;left:135"><nobr>civil rights – in 1957 (it was blacked out in the press), where we heard the young Dr.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:6682;left:135"><nobr>Martin Luther King speak at the Washington Monument. I began to participate in pickets</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:6703;left:135"><nobr>of Woolworth stores in support of the southern lunch-counter sit-ins which began in</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:6724;left:135"><nobr>Greensboro NC in 1960. In high school I joined a chapter of the Student Peace Union</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:6744;left:135"><nobr>(started not by the Communists as one might imagine, but by their bitter rivals the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:6765;left:135"><nobr>Socialist Party), and picketed at both City Hall and at the White House in 1962 during the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:6786;left:135"><nobr>Cuban Missile Crisis.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:6827;left:135"><nobr>I therefore sought out the analogous crowd at Berkeley and found myself walking a</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:6848;left:135"><nobr>picket line in San Francisco protesting a visit by Madame Nhu, the “dragon lady” of</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:6868;left:135"><nobr>South Vietnam. With me on the line was Allen Ginsburg, gentle, hugely bearded and the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:6889;left:135"><nobr>new winner of a substantial prize for poetry. I took a cab back to Berkeley because I was</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:6910;left:135"><nobr>unwilling to ask how to find the busses. I dressed like a janitor, often with a grey sweat</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:6931;left:135"><nobr>shirt (a kind of uniform for the bohemians) and cut my own hair very short with an</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:6951;left:135"><nobr>electric clipper.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:6993;left:135"><nobr>Disappear. Be swallowed up in the human throng – this was a kind of death wish. Not for</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:7014;left:135"><nobr>my body but for my personhood. My credo was, in effect – be useful or be invisible, but</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:7034;left:135"><nobr>above all don’t depend on anyone. </nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:7075;left:135"><nobr>The expectations I felt at the time were to become a sufficiently skilled engineer and to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:7096;left:135"><nobr>participate as a functionary in the grand process of automation of labor. This attitude is</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:7117;left:135"><nobr>the basis for Kurt Vonnegut’s first book – “Player Piano”, written in 1952. If I were good</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:7138;left:135"><nobr>at my work I could ascend to engineering management. Information about what people</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:7158;left:135"><nobr>wanted and needed would be provided to me by a large apparatus consisting of social </nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:7456;left:135"><nobr>was to be the increasing obsolescence of manual labor. This, I felt, without much</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:7601;left:135"><nobr>needed to both do this and carry a student load. My grades were .07 grade point below</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:7622;left:135"><nobr>the B average needed to qualify for scholarship assistance. I was loath to ask my father</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:7642;left:135"><nobr>for more money – usually he would call when my bank balance had fallen below $5.00</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:7663;left:135"><nobr>and I would reluctantly accept some money. I considered giving money to someone as</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:7684;left:135"><nobr>one of the worst things that one could do to them. </nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:7725;left:135"><nobr>I found out about the Co-operative Work-Study Program in Engineering through word of</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:7746;left:135"><nobr>mouth. Extend the time to get a degree to five years from four and one could spend three</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:7767;left:135"><nobr>alternating work-study cycles of six months each, with the jobs tailored specifically for</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:7788;left:135"><nobr>the population and listed with the Co-op office at the College of Engineering offices. I</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:7808;left:135"><nobr>signed up in a flash and secured a civil service job as an “engineering aide” at the NASA</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:7870;left:135"><nobr>Oh, I was delighted to walk those halls in a short-sleeved white shirt and tie! The work</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:7891;left:135"><nobr>was as difficult as I wanted it to be, and I plunged into it, pleasing my supervisors. I ran</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:7912;left:135"><nobr>vibration tests on components and designed some simple circuitry to assist in the testing.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:7932;left:135"><nobr>The desert heat was hellish and I was going through most of the mistakes and ineptness</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:7953;left:135"><nobr>that accompanies a first attempt to live independently, but I really felt part of the</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:8015;left:135"><nobr>Return to Berkeley</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:8056;left:135"><nobr>Until the machine developed indigestion. The position required the lowest possible level</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:8077;left:135"><nobr>of security clearance – “confidential”. I had dutifully filled out the necessary six-page</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:8098;left:135"><nobr>form 398 and passed it in – this gave the FBI information on where I had lived and with</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:8119;left:135"><nobr>whom I had associated in the past. I checked the box that had be swear that I knew no</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:8139;left:135"><nobr>Communists. </nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:8181;left:135"><nobr>Seven years later, when facing the draft, I read the legal regulations, and found that for</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:8222;left:135"><nobr>such malefactors as “spies, saboteurs, traitors, anarchists or revolutionists” (note the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:8243;left:135"><nobr>spelling direct from 1919) would require approval by a specific bureaucrat. That made</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:8263;left:135"><nobr>avoiding the draft much easier for me (I as eventually told to go home and wait, and am</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:8284;left:135"><nobr>waiting still). </nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:8326;left:135"><nobr>In this case I wanted to stay, but was gently told to resign “to return to school”. The</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:8346;left:135"><nobr>reason given was the fear that I might picket Edwards Air Force Base as I had picketed </nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:9037;left:135"><nobr>going on. I had read some confused newspaper articles about a “riot” on campus in</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:9058;left:135"><nobr>October, but had conflated it with tales of “panty raid” rioting from 1952. It was anything</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:9079;left:135"><nobr>but.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:9120;left:135"><nobr>I refer the reader to the website <font color="#0000ff">www.fsm-a.org </font>for the whole historical story. In sum, the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:9141;left:135"><nobr>University administration, led by a premature neoconservative dean who claimed to have</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:9162;left:135"><nobr>the support of the President, clamped down on student activity on campus in support of</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:9183;left:135"><nobr>the civil rights movement. In the fall after Freedom Summer, the explosion was</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:9203;left:135"><nobr>inevitable. </nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:9244;left:135"><nobr>On Sept. 30 students defied the ban and set up a recruiting table for civil rights groups in</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:9265;left:135"><nobr>the main plaza. One person, an alumnus and thus a non-student, was arrested and placed</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:9286;left:135"><nobr>in a police car which was brought up right in front of the administration building.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:9307;left:135"><nobr>Immediately students sat down around the car, immobilizing it for 32 hours and some,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:9327;left:135"><nobr>permitted by the outnumbered police, climbed atop the car to address the group. An</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:9348;left:135"><nobr>unprecedented open forum was thus created, wherein the history of the administration’s</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:9369;left:135"><nobr>previous clampdowns and mendacity was recounted. This was the beginnings of a</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:9390;left:135"><nobr>community in the midst of a crowd.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:9431;left:135"><nobr>The sit-in was relieved through tense negotiations with the President of the University as</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:9451;left:135"><nobr>hundreds of bully-boy Oakland police assembled to commit mayhem and the parents of</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:9472;left:135"><nobr>students were to show up the next day, possibly to confront the scene of bloodshed and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:9493;left:135"><nobr>mass arrests. There ensued a period of continued negotiations, false starts, and political</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:9514;left:135"><nobr>ferment among students. I walked into the middle of this. </nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:9832;left:135"><nobr>admonished to “keep my nose clean” by the representative of the security apparatus.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:9853;left:135"><nobr>While growing up I had read much about “destroyed careers”, especially in the</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:9915;left:135"><nobr>Was my career in jeopardy? That was the question – and what career? I had seen that not</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:9936;left:135"><nobr>everyone was about to shun me in the off-campus world. I remembered well the face and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:9957;left:135"><nobr>southern accent of the security director at NASA, and the drunken personnel specialist. It</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:9977;left:135"><nobr>came down to whom I was willing to throw in with, especially at a time when my career</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:9998;left:135"><nobr>direction was still ahead of me – plastic, moldable. </nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:10039;left:135"><nobr>Recalling Huckleberry Finn’s existential decision to help his fiend Jim, an escaped slave,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:10060;left:135"><nobr>I said “all right, I’ll go to hell!” and made up my mind to help in the struggle. It was my</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:10081;left:135"><nobr>own existential decision – one that cut to the heart of “who am I, and what is my place in</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:10101;left:135"><nobr>the world?” I took it somewhat reluctantly, as it meant that the easy path was closed to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:10122;left:135"><nobr>me. </nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:10164;left:135"><nobr>At the wrap-up of the Free Speech Movement I recall hearing Mario Savio, a philosophy</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:10184;left:135"><nobr>major, comment that “Kierkegaard was right – the only free acts are those you can’t help</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:10205;left:135"><nobr>taking”, when referring to the moment when hundreds sat down around the police car. I</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:10225;left:135"><nobr>had my own such moment. I cannot imagine what might have become of me had I</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:10246;left:135"><nobr>decided to play it safe.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:10288;left:135"><nobr>Immersion</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:10329;left:135"><nobr>Once I had decided to commit to the FSM, my course was clear – I would attempt to find</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:10350;left:135"><nobr>some way to turn my technical skills to serve its ends. Electronically, I considered myself</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:10371;left:135"><nobr>to be an audio person – certainly not an expert, but capable of setting up, running and, if</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:10391;left:135"><nobr>necessary, repairing audio equipment. I owned a large, good-quality tape recorder (7 inch</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:10412;left:135"><nobr>reels of ¼ inch tape – this was before cassettes) and decided to see if I could use it in the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:10432;left:135"><nobr>service of the FSM. This brought me to Press Central – a dramatic name for a basement</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:10453;left:135"><nobr>in a house, wherein resided a mimeograph machine and a plank table at which Richard</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:10474;left:135"><nobr>Schmorelitz and Thom Irwin labored to relate to the press.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:10515;left:135"><nobr>I volunteered to make audio press releases. The fact that I didn’t just show up and ask</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:10536;left:135"><nobr>what I could do is telling – it shows that I was more willing to take initiative and try to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:10557;left:135"><nobr>implement a new idea than my self-image allowed. Something was clearly coming forth.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:10578;left:135"><nobr>After some futile attempts to make these unheard-of audio press releases I gave up on</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:10598;left:135"><nobr>that idea (the responses from the electronic press were incredulousness), and stayed</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:10619;left:135"><nobr>around to help with the mimeo work. I owned a tiny mo-ped type scooter – one with</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:10639;left:135"><nobr>auxiliary pedals – and could help by running supplies and stencils around among the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:10660;left:135"><nobr>other “centrals”. </nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:10702;left:135"><nobr>In this capacity I was introduced to the idea of distributed production. There were many</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:10722;left:135"><nobr>organizations around town that also had mimeograph machines, and in one case they </nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:10979;left:135"><nobr>were all pressed into service to turn out a thick document overnight. Berkeley being quite</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:10999;left:135"><nobr>focused on social science, sociology, etc., there were many studies launched as soon as</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:11020;left:135"><nobr>the Free Speech Movement broke out. One was turned out by graduate students in the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:11041;left:135"><nobr>History department, and was to be presented to an official committee looking into the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:11062;left:135"><nobr>situation. The FSM got permission to print and distribute it widely on campus – the only</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:11082;left:135"><nobr>problem was how to produce the report of almost a hundred pages.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:11124;left:135"><nobr>The volunteer lists were called and people asked if they could type a stencil (mimeos</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:11145;left:135"><nobr>used an oil-impregnated paper stencil which was placed in a typewriter - where the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:11165;left:135"><nobr>pressure of the type squeezed the oil out was where ink could flow through and become</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:11186;left:135"><nobr>an impression on the paper). Groups with a mimeo were contacted and asked to turn out</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:11206;left:135"><nobr>one page each. I found myself as one of many couriers shuttling paper to and from these</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:11227;left:135"><nobr>individual mimeos. The assembly of all the pages was done at the dining tables of a</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:11248;left:135"><nobr>student co-op, Oxford Hall, where I later lived. The effort was a success, and the report</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:11269;left:135"><nobr>was widely disseminated by volunteers on campus.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:11310;left:135"><nobr>This was an impressive accomplishment, in my view. We could assemble a large printing</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:11331;left:135"><nobr>plant when necessary out of resources already in place, just by coordination. It was an</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:11352;left:135"><nobr>information problem, not a physical problem to do this. This experience planted a seed in</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:11372;left:135"><nobr>my mind about how resources could be used more efficiently through information</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:11393;left:135"><nobr>networking.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:11434;left:135"><nobr>I began hanging around the main office, FSM Central, to see if I could apply my</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:11455;left:135"><nobr>technical skills (such as they were – more a matter of approaching a problem than of</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:11476;left:135"><nobr>having particular skills) to the information management problem. I discovered a table</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:11496;left:135"><nobr>(made of a door laid across two sawhorses) with two telephones and lots of notices</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:11517;left:135"><nobr>posted on the wall behind it. These notices listed offers of resources or labor as well as</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:11538;left:135"><nobr>needs. Connecting the two was the necessary art. </nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:11579;left:135"><nobr>I tried a few card-filing techniques but was foiled by my inexperience and lack of money</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:11600;left:135"><nobr>(hint – you can’t create clean, aligned holes through a stack of index cards using a power</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:11620;left:135"><nobr>drill – it simply creates fuzz). Nevertheless, I understood that this vernacular filing</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:11641;left:135"><nobr>system, which was really acting inside the minds of the people who maintained it, would</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:11662;left:135"><nobr>need some technical assist in order to be more broadly usable. It was later that I</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:11683;left:135"><nobr>concluded that computers in networks could do this.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:11724;left:135"><nobr>Turning Point</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:11766;left:135"><nobr>Then came a most important occurrence, which I refer to as the “police radio incident”.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:11786;left:135"><nobr>One night someone ran into the office (which was a rented house some students had been</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:11807;left:135"><nobr>sharing) and announced excitedly that “the campus was surrounded by police”.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:11827;left:135"><nobr>Consternation ensued, and one person there who knew my inclination asked me, in a loud</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:11848;left:135"><nobr>voice “quick – make us a police radio”. To my perception the entire house full of people</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:11869;left:135"><nobr>had made this demand with one voice and were hanging on my reply. </nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:12167;left:135"><nobr>It was not a totally fantastic request. In 1939 I could have opened a broadcast band radio</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:12187;left:135"><nobr>and, with a screwdriver, changed the local oscillator frequency so as to bring in the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:12208;left:135"><nobr>frequencies just above the high end of the band. This was where police calls were then</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:12229;left:135"><nobr>transmitted. But as of the 1950’s this service had moved far up the spectrum and used</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:12250;left:135"><nobr>narrow-band FM, which is difficult to detect. “You don’t understand,” I stammered, “it</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:12270;left:135"><nobr>takes time.”</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:12312;left:135"><nobr>The response seemed to come from all mouths at once: “Never mind about that – make us</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:12333;left:135"><nobr>a police radio!” The stupidity of this demand took my breath away. Here were people I</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:12353;left:135"><nobr>considered my intellectual superiors, people who were studying the intricacies of human</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:12374;left:135"><nobr>behavior, who were easy and confident in the incredible arcane of human interactions,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:12394;left:135"><nobr>and they come up with this? The words betrayed a massive misunderstanding of how</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:12415;left:135"><nobr>technological projects were carried out. </nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:12457;left:135"><nobr>I had assumed that my destiny was to labor at technological tasks under the direction of</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:12477;left:135"><nobr>exactly this sort of person. But I knew better than them! It became crystal clear to me that</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:12498;left:135"><nobr>I could not pass off the responsibility of fundamental technological decisions to these</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:12519;left:135"><nobr>folks or really anybody else. I had to organize my activities so that my response to the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:12540;left:135"><nobr>demand “make a police radio” would be “well, you can’t have that, but here’s what I’ve</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:12560;left:135"><nobr>got available”. In effect, the news was that I was in charge of my own actions and would</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:12581;left:135"><nobr>always be if I wanted to be useful to people who needed my help. I would have to figure</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:12601;left:135"><nobr>out my long range directions on my own. At that moment I stopped waiting for orders. </nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:12726;left:460"><nobr>to Dec. 8, 1964, when the Academic Senate</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:12747;left:135"><nobr>at Berkeley voted by a large margin to adopt the position of the FSM that University</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:12767;left:135"><nobr>administration may not regulate content of speech on campus – merely time, place and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:12788;left:135"><nobr>manner. This seems like a moderately legalistic and arcane point when presented this</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:12808;left:135"><nobr>simply – but it was the opening of the counterculture. Mere students – raw material in the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:12829;left:135"><nobr>world view of the administrators who held the metaphor of university as factory – had</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:12850;left:135"><nobr>managed to fight the administration of a vast state university to a standstill and drive</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:12871;left:135"><nobr>them back to a position never previously accepted. </nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:12912;left:135"><nobr>In a very real sense it was a revolution. My reference here is a book entitled “The</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:12933;left:135"><nobr>Conquest of Bread” by Peter Kropotkin, the Russian “anarchist prince” and theorist of</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:12954;left:135"><nobr>anarchism. Examining the Mexican Revolution of 1910, Kropotkin evokes the change in</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:12974;left:135"><nobr>consciousness that comes over the peons when the revolution occurs. To paraphrase;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:12995;left:135"><nobr>everything becomes possible when the hand of oppressive authority disappears. I say that</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:13015;left:135"><nobr>we experienced a revolution because that is what I experienced in the winter of 1964 –</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:13036;left:135"><nobr>65. A large fraction of students at Berkeley made major changes in their life paths. Many</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:13057;left:135"><nobr>dropped out and moved to a neighborhood in San Francisco where they felt they could</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:13078;left:135"><nobr>live more the way they wanted – the Haight-Ashbury. Study curriculums changed, essays</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:13582;left:135"><nobr>been dropped in the midst of the crisis – it became acceptable to talk to strangers about</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:13603;left:135"><nobr>the situation, and then other things, and that this had precipitated a sense of community. I</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:13624;left:135"><nobr>am indebted to him for this analysis – it has been borne out in my observations since</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:13645;left:135"><nobr>then. </nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:13686;left:135"><nobr>Now What?</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:13728;left:135"><nobr>As “The Sixties” got under way for real, I tried to discover my role as autonomous and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:13748;left:135"><nobr>self-directed engineer assisting what we still called “the movement” (the term was a</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:13769;left:135"><nobr>holdover from the civil rights movement, but now encompassed a number of additional</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:13789;left:135"><nobr>salients – antiwar, feminist, gay freedom, etc.). I joined the underground press, having</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:13810;left:135"><nobr>discovered a previously dormant talent for writing, and saw it change from small,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:13831;left:135"><nobr>clandestinely distributed eight-sheet weeklies filled with subversive text to 50 and 60</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:13852;left:135"><nobr>pages of display advertisements. I saw how the act of distributing leaflets on campus – a</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:13872;left:135"><nobr>highly risky activity during the FSM when it was nominally forbidden – disappear and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:13893;left:135"><nobr>leaflets show up posted in geometric patterns on walls to attract attention. </nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:13935;left:135"><nobr>I began to analyze the structure of media from this standpoint. Most media were</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:13955;left:135"><nobr>centralized, emitting identical information from one point, and created a relationship in</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:13976;left:135"><nobr>which the recipients were passive spectators. But we had won the FSM without such</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:13996;left:135"><nobr>media in our hands. We produced leaflets – millions of pages in all – but they were</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:14017;left:135"><nobr>carried on to campus and handed out by individuals who put themselves at risk in doing</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:14038;left:135"><nobr>so and were available for conversation. Information came back from them, from networks</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:14059;left:135"><nobr>of relationships – the man who ran the game room at the student union was one of ours,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:14079;left:135"><nobr>for instance, and fed back how students reacted to the situation of the moment. We had a</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:14100;left:135"><nobr>network of representatives from various living arrangements – dorms, fraternities,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:14121;left:135"><nobr>independents, and they served as two-way information conduits and aggregators. The</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:14142;left:135"><nobr>information structure that had worked in creating a revolution was not hierarchical, one-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:14162;left:135"><nobr>way, broadcast in nature, but non-broadcast. Its best analogue was the telephone network,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:14183;left:135"><nobr>but this was still not a complete equivalent. </nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:14224;left:135"><nobr>I disengaged from the underground press around 1970, as I decided that the broadcast</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:14245;left:135"><nobr>model was not what I wanted to foster. The function of the telephone table in the FSM</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:14266;left:135"><nobr>Central had become a series of “switchboards” by then – special purpose information</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:14286;left:135"><nobr>referral points, dealing with one issue or area each, and always in a state of </nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:14563;left:135"><nobr>overloaded and left. I looked into them and, while there was certainly a need for some</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:14584;left:135"><nobr>technological assistance, the motivations were always something else from the operation</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:14605;left:135"><nobr>of an efficient information process. </nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:14646;left:135"><nobr>Thinking that the counterculture was best represented by networks of “intentional</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:14688;left:135"><nobr>temporarily, I tried to create the “Berkeley Network Bulletin” – a mimeographed</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:14709;left:135"><nobr>collection of announcements solicited from each house and delivered to all houses by</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:14729;left:135"><nobr>courier. Unfortunately, I was in the grip of clinical depression at that point and could not</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:14750;left:135"><nobr>focus enough energy to make it work.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:14791;left:135"><nobr>The Unseen World</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:14833;left:135"><nobr>I had dropped out of college when my depression came on in late 1967, and went to work</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:14853;left:135"><nobr>in Silicon Valley as a junior engineer (no degree required) at a large corporation. In 1970</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:14874;left:135"><nobr>I was sent to learn the Basic computer language at what was then called a “service</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:14895;left:135"><nobr>bureau”. This was company that had set up a computer network (a very expensive</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:14916;left:135"><nobr>undertaking at the time) and sold access to it through offices, to which work would be</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:14936;left:135"><nobr>sent. They also sold training services. The instructors were quite full of themselves, and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:14957;left:135"><nobr>would make comments like “You see the terminal sort of hiccup and start working more</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:14977;left:135"><nobr>slowly? That’s because they switched off the computer in Los Angeles and we’re now</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:14998;left:135"><nobr>working on the computer in Kansas City.”</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:15040;left:135"><nobr>Very interesting, indeed. On a network there was no center, or the center moved around.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:15060;left:135"><nobr>Place – geography – was of little importance. Everywhere on the network was the same</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:15081;left:135"><nobr>place!</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:15123;left:135"><nobr>The instructors also pointed out a trick – you could give a file different levels of</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:15143;left:135"><nobr>accessibility by prepending different numbers of asterisks to the file name. Thus, one</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:15164;left:135"><nobr>asterisk made it available to the group you belonged to, two made it accessible to the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:15184;left:135"><nobr>group to which that group belonged, and three made it accessible to all users. This meant</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:15205;left:135"><nobr>that a kind of multi-level publication scheme was possible. Information could be kept</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:15226;left:135"><nobr>within communities of interest, and these communities need not have a geographical</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:15247;left:135"><nobr>basis. It seemed to me that I had found my sought-for non-broadcast communication</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:15267;left:135"><nobr>medium.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:15309;left:135"><nobr>“Fine,” I remember thinking, “all you need is a computer. Where are you going to get a</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:15330;left:135"><nobr>computer?” Of course, the answer was beginning to assemble itself at that very time. The</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:15350;left:135"><nobr>reason I had been sent to learn Basic was that I had been assigned to the development of a</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:15371;left:135"><nobr>large-scale audio-visual information system that was controlled by a minicomputer – one</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:15391;left:135"><nobr>that would sit comfortably on a desktop and cost about $10,000 in the money of the day –</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:15412;left:135"><nobr>about $30,000 in today’s dollars.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:15454;left:135"><nobr>Lest the reader draw too close a comparison, the minicomputer still needed a terminal –</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:15474;left:135"><nobr>usually a mechanical teleprinter built for Western Union or an IBM Selectric typewriter </nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:15751;left:135"><nobr>networking – well, we did have a modem as part of our system. It was about two and a</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:15814;left:135"><nobr>was rented out by the phone company, as nothing but their equipment could contact their</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:15834;left:135"><nobr>lines. I never learned the cost, but it must have been hundreds of dollars per month. And</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:15855;left:135"><nobr>yes, there was no hard disc – no storage medium other than punched paper tape rattling</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:15876;left:135"><nobr>through at ten bytes per second.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:15917;left:135"><nobr>Early Efforts with Primitive Technology</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:15958;left:135"><nobr>This was the period of the big “mobilization” marches to protest the Vietnam War. Tens</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:15979;left:135"><nobr>or hundreds of thousands of people would gather to walk from point A to point B and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:16000;left:135"><nobr>listen to speeches before dispersing. A San Francisco radio talk show host named Chan</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:16021;left:135"><nobr>Lockman whose air name was Travis T. Hipp jogged me by asking “if we’re going to get</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:16041;left:135"><nobr>all those people to have a march, why not actually do something? Who has ideas about</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:16062;left:135"><nobr>what such a thing would be?” I sat at the Teletype at work for the better part of a day</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:16083;left:135"><nobr>looking busy and typing up my reply.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:16124;left:135"><nobr>We could march out to some large building where we could gather indoors and be</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:16145;left:135"><nobr>entertained while we filled out cards indicating our interests, what resources we had</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:16165;left:135"><nobr>available, what we wanted to do, and whatever gratuitous comments we wished to make.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:16186;left:135"><nobr>Then, a crew of people would sort the cards, probably by geography, copy the contents to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:16207;left:135"><nobr>stencils and mimeograph pages of the card images so that there was one copy of every</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:16228;left:135"><nobr>sheet for each person submitting. Then, on the way out, each person there would pick up</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:16248;left:135"><nobr>one sheet. Presto – instant directory! When everybody went away they would have with</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:16269;left:135"><nobr>them the names of everybody else, how to contact them, and what they need, have, or</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:16290;left:135"><nobr>were interested in. The barriers to interpersonal communication would be seriously</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:16311;left:135"><nobr>lowered, though probably not completely down.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:16352;left:135"><nobr>It’s still a good thing to do for any one-of-a-kind gathering, and a lot easier with</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:16372;left:135"><nobr>photocopiers. I’ve done it a few times, and the people who attend go away happy.  It’s a</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:16435;left:135"><nobr>The Revolution Continues</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:16476;left:135"><nobr>In 1969 came the People’s Park conflict in Berkeley, and I saw the same signs of</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:16497;left:135"><nobr>revolution – the feeling that anything was possible, the creativity of the construction</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:16518;left:135"><nobr>period, the euphoria (though tempered by the fact of nominal military occupation and the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:16538;left:135"><nobr>death of one demonstrator and blinding of another by roving sheriff’s deputies armed</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:16559;left:135"><nobr>with shotguns). </nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:16600;left:135"><nobr>In the aftermath a group of architects briefly formed as “People’s Architects” and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:16621;left:135"><nobr>produced a visionary plan for Berkeley. One aspect that caught my attention was the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:16642;left:135"><nobr>concept of “Life Houses” – neighborhood open houses where people could gather in</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:16662;left:135"><nobr>small community centers. To this I added the idea of having tools for information </nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:16919;left:135"><nobr>reproduction – copiers, etc., available for use by anyone with something to print up. The</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:16939;left:135"><nobr>centers would maintain local bulletin boards out on the street (some people were doing</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:16960;left:135"><nobr>this already) and could set up routes whereby notices could be posted and passed along to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:16981;left:135"><nobr>other life houses.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:17022;left:135"><nobr>Down the Rabbit Hole</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:17064;left:135"><nobr>Later I added the idea of a computer terminal to a central system serving a city. This</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:17085;left:135"><nobr>came after my experience with Resource One. To return to 1971, I was wondering how a</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:17105;left:135"><nobr>computer network could be put together when one of those synchronistic events</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:17126;left:135"><nobr>happened. Obviously I had been talking about the idea, because one Arnold Egel, a wild-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:17146;left:135"><nobr>eyed sort of guy who might have displayed a more advanced level of Asperger’s, came</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:17167;left:135"><nobr>running up to me on Telegraph Avenue, excitedly announcing to me that there was a</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:17188;left:135"><nobr>group in San Francisco who actually had gotten a computer to do what I had been hoping</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:17209;left:135"><nobr>to do. I checked it out and began attending meetings of this group. They were a nucleus</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:17229;left:135"><nobr>of four computer science students who had abandoned UC Berkeley during the Cambodia</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:17250;left:135"><nobr>invasion crisis, which shut the universities down for about a week and (in this case)</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:17271;left:135"><nobr>impelled some students to go and do what they were talking about. They migrated to San</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:17292;left:135"><nobr>Francisco and set up an organization called Computer Group One as part of a “warehouse</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:17312;left:135"><nobr>community” that had formed at the same time – a number of counterculturists who piled</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:17333;left:135"><nobr>into an empty building (rented, not squatted) and under the guidance of some architects</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:17353;left:135"><nobr>attempted to set up their own community within four walls, known as Project One. </nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:17395;left:135"><nobr>They started by securing some service-bureau on-line time and trying to make it available</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:17416;left:135"><nobr>to other counterculture groups. They gained membership in a “youth meets the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:17436;left:135"><nobr>Establishment” weekly meeting which came about because the business establishment</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:17457;left:135"><nobr>was caught off guard by the development of the counterculture and wanted to know more</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:17478;left:135"><nobr>about who these people were and what their interests were. Through that network Pam</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:17499;left:135"><nobr>Hardt, one of the founders and the clear leader of the group, had managed to secure the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:17519;left:135"><nobr>“long term loan” of a mainframe computer capable of timesharing – that is, running many</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:17540;left:135"><nobr>jobs at once and keeping the whole mess straight with one job per terminal. </nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:17581;left:135"><nobr>I arrived in September 1971 when the donation had just been secured and volunteered to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:17602;left:135"><nobr>help on understanding and maintaining the hardware. In the first six months of 1972, with</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:17623;left:135"><nobr>my depression relieved by several years of therapy, I re-entered Berkeley and finished my</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:17643;left:135"><nobr>degree work in June of that year. I then moved directly in to Project One and threw</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:17664;left:135"><nobr>myself into setting up the computer. The day it was installed the man who was to teach</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:17685;left:135"><nobr>me maintenance of the computer disappeared, not to be seen for several months, in effect</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:17706;left:135"><nobr>leaving me to tend the baby. </nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:17747;left:135"><nobr>I brought Efrem Lipkin in from Berkeley to work on the operating system software. I had</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:17767;left:135"><nobr>in effect attached myself to his household, which I had come across when I met Jude</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:17788;left:135"><nobr>Milhon in 1968. I looked up to Efrem and placed him in the niche which had been created</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:17809;left:135"><nobr>in my psyche by my older brother.  </nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:18231;left:135"><nobr>The Commons of Information Discovered</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18273;left:135"><nobr>When we were ready to offer computer services, mostly in the form of an information-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18293;left:135"><nobr>retrieval program to the counterculture, they weren’t ready for us. We had let our</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18314;left:135"><nobr>connections atrophy, and the prospect of paying $150 per month to rent a computer</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18334;left:135"><nobr>terminal was far too daunting for any rag-tag group with a switchboard to contemplate.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18355;left:135"><nobr>We were left with a computer and no users. We tried to interest the Bay Area Reference</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18376;left:135"><nobr>Council – a sort of library among libraries – in using it and were presented with an</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18397;left:135"><nobr>interesting metaphor – you seem to have shelves, the librarians said, with no books on</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18417;left:135"><nobr>them. Come back when you have some books.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18459;left:135"><nobr>Efrem took this comment and concluded that we could put terminals out in public places</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18480;left:135"><nobr>and collect the “books”. It was a radical idea, one that I’m sure I wouldn’t have had. We</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18500;left:135"><nobr>did it. In August 1973 we opened the first of four terminals available for walk-up use in</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18521;left:135"><nobr>Berkeley and San Francisco. We called it “Community Memory” and it was a shared</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18541;left:135"><nobr>bulletin board which placed no limitation on the users’ ability to categorize items posted.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18583;left:135"><nobr>It was a success in terms of attracting use. The first terminal, a teletype, was set up next</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18604;left:135"><nobr>to a musician’s bulletin board and attracted the music trade, in addition to more. In effect,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18624;left:135"><nobr>we had created the computer-enabled life house in many ways. There were almost no</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18645;left:135"><nobr>examples of people shying away from this alien technology – as soon as we told someone</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18666;left:135"><nobr>who approached it that they could use it themselves, without intermediation, the users</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18687;left:135"><nobr>brightened up and asked if they really could use it. </nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18728;left:135"><nobr>In seeing this dynamic in operation and in considering the necessity to make the terminals</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18748;left:135"><nobr>less expensive and more reliable, I set off on what was to become the pursuit of the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18769;left:135"><nobr>personal computer. Two events affected my course seriously. First, the publication in</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18790;left:135"><nobr>1973 of a do-it-yourself article in an electronics hobbyist magazine purporting to show</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18811;left:135"><nobr>how to build a “TV Typewriter” whereby letters and numbers typed on a keyboard would</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18831;left:135"><nobr>appear on a TV screen whose antenna was connected to the device. There was an</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18852;left:135"><nobr>outpouring a response – 10,000 people sent in two dollars each for the plans. This</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18873;left:135"><nobr>indicated that something big was happening, there was a resonance at a certain point in</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18894;left:135"><nobr>the public for something which appeared to give real control over what the TV showed,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18914;left:135"><nobr>and which did so by using digital “computer” technology.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18955;left:135"><nobr>The second event was communication from my father, who had become quite a “new</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18976;left:135"><nobr>ager”, pointing me to the writings of Ivan Illich, a former Jesuit and a wide-ranging</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18997;left:135"><nobr>intellectual who had previously proposed abolishing the compulsory education system in</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:19018;left:135"><nobr>favor of direct instruction. He had just issued a small book entitled “Tools for</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:19038;left:135"><nobr>Conviviality” discussing peoples’ relationship with technology. In it Illich posited a </nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:19315;left:135"><nobr>being understood, manipulated and modified to individual ends. </nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:19357;left:135"><nobr>Illich told the story of how, when radio technology was introduced to the Central</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:19378;left:135"><nobr>American Jungle (he did his research from Cuernivaca in Mexico), within two years there</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:19398;left:135"><nobr>were people in these remote outposts who could repair the radios. These people had</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:19419;left:135"><nobr>always been there, and had never taken formal instruction, but the technology was open</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:19440;left:135"><nobr>and forgiving enough to allow them to learn by trial and error, along with oral instruction</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:19461;left:135"><nobr>from others with a little more skill. Vacuum-tube radios would not burn out at the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:19481;left:135"><nobr>slightest outrage, unlike transistor radios. I knew this because I had basically learned</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:19502;left:135"><nobr>about radio the same way, albeit with a home-study course, but still setting up my own</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:19522;left:135"><nobr>workshop and trying to build things. </nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:19564;left:135"><nobr>Revolution in the Digital Domain</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:19605;left:135"><nobr>I began to consider how computer terminals and computers themselves could be designed</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:19626;left:135"><nobr>to be “convivial”. I made contact with a tiny underground culture of computer-skilled</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:19647;left:135"><nobr>people who met weekly for potluck dinners to discuss that very question. We taught each</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:19668;left:135"><nobr>other and formed a small community, centered around a kind of underground newspaper</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:19688;left:135"><nobr>for those sharing the vision of computers for everybody, children included. </nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:19729;left:135"><nobr>By 1974 I had turned out a specification for what I called “The Tom Swift Terminal, or,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:19750;left:135"><nobr>A Convivial Cybernetic Device”. For readers not familiar with the name, Tom Swift was</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:19771;left:135"><nobr>a central character of a series of boys’ books who was in effect a young Edison –</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:19792;left:135"><nobr>inventing his way through various adventures. I named the design after him “…in honor</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:19812;left:135"><nobr>of the character most likely to be found tampering with the equipment”. </nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:19854;left:135"><nobr>The principle of conviviality which I introduced into the specification was summed up in</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:19875;left:135"><nobr>an aphorism: “in order to survive in a public environment, a computer must grow a</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:19895;left:135"><nobr>computer club about itself”. The problem, therefore, was to design something that could</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:19916;left:135"><nobr>grow from a terminal into a computer and further into a network of computers, all the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:19936;left:135"><nobr>time attracting the technologically curious to attempt to reconfigure it to their needs. </nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:19978;left:135"><nobr>In this spec I worked out the details of implementing video display in a computer. I did</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:19999;left:135"><nobr>the basic design work which allowed me to understand how such a video signal would be</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:20019;left:135"><nobr>put together and how it would map directly from random-access memory. In effect, it</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:20040;left:135"><nobr>collapsed the computer and the video display terminal into one device. I can lay claim to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:20061;left:135"><nobr>the invention of the personal computer if that is how “personal computer” is defined. I</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:20082;left:135"><nobr>mimeographed (of course) the spec and sold it to other enthusiasts for 25 cents. </nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:20123;left:135"><nobr>Shortly thereafter the lid blew off – the first personal computer was announced as a</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:20143;left:135"><nobr>product (actually it was correctly titled a “minicomputer” as it lacked the terminal). The</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:20164;left:135"><nobr>response was tremendous, long waits developed for the product, and this attracted others</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:20185;left:135"><nobr>into a new market, including myself. I was into my next career, which lies beyond the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:20206;left:135"><nobr>purview of this essay. </nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:20483;left:135"><nobr>Looking Back</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:20524;left:135"><nobr>To sum up, I found myself in a revolution and learned step by step that there is a need</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:20545;left:135"><nobr>within each human being for the function of the agora – the public space of the Greek</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:20566;left:135"><nobr>city-states in which political and commercial life was carried out. This space has been</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:20586;left:135"><nobr>privatized into the mass media, but there are still times and places in which people come</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:20607;left:135"><nobr>together and these are opportunities to recover this function, which I call the “commons</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:20628;left:135"><nobr>of information”. The Free Speech Movement created an agora out of what was available</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:20649;left:135"><nobr>– destroyed the barriers to communication person-to-person, and won because of the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:20669;left:135"><nobr>creative energy thus liberated. This happened more or less without being calculated, but</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:20690;left:135"><nobr>those who led the activity could at least sense it and respond, because they had set up a</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:20710;left:135"><nobr>sensitive, bilateral information structure. </nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:20752;left:135"><nobr>I continued to find ways to embody the function of the agora not in bricks and concrete,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:20773;left:135"><nobr>like a public plaza, but in electronic and digital technology. The vision of the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:20793;left:135"><nobr>revolutionary society, glimpsed first hand at least once, was powerful enough to impel</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:20814;left:135"><nobr>me. I was fortunate to have been shown the foolishness of placing my own power into the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:20835;left:135"><nobr>hands of others, even though I knew I was not as facile as they were in human affairs. </nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:20876;left:135"><nobr>Like everyone, I sometimes wonder “what if..?” The problem is that most of the answers</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:20897;left:135"><nobr>are much worse than what actually happened. I benefited greatly from the actions,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:20917;left:135"><nobr>sensibilities, advice and skills of others, and managed to make my way relatively</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:20938;left:135"><nobr>unscathed, not financially wealthy but wealthy in reputation, having accomplished a</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:20959;left:135"><nobr>number of things but always with more envisioned than I could possibly fulfill. I hope to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:20980;left:135"><nobr>continue by delegating ideas and visions to others, but that part of my career lies mostly</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:21000;left:135"><nobr>in the future. This essay has been one of my first attempts in that direction </nobr></div>
