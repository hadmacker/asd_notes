  > “activity buffers” have literally been the SECRET to reducing my meltdowns. i used to get so overwhelmed at the end of the day, and then we started taking breaks in the middle of the day where i can just chill and it gives me enough charge to go back out and finish up. i haven’t had a meltdown related to my schedule since i started doing that.
