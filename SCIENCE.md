  * Boys vs. Girls: Is there a difference between the sexes and systemizing? Turns out yes (discussed in video above.)
    * This may explain why ASD is more prevalent in boys over girls.

# Neurology

In the book, [The Autistic Mind, Temple Grandin](https://www.amazon.ca/Autistic-Brain-Helping-Different-Succeed/dp/0544227735), the author goes on to show MRI imaging of her brain, with comparison of a typical brain, and is used to support her claim of "thinking in pictures".
