### Autism Warrior Parenting

> Autism Warrior Parents (AWPs) insist on supporting their autistic kids either by trying to cure them, or by imposing non-autistic-oriented goals on them — rather than by trying to understand how their kids are wired, and how that wiring affects their life experience.

### Interventions

* **Developmental Individual Difference Relation-Based Intervention (DIR)**
  * Developed by Stanley Greenspan and Serena Wieder, approach autism from a developmental point of view rather than as a behavioral issue. DIR is a less-structured model for behavioral intervention, focusing on strengthening and then building upon the emotional bond of the child with his or her caregiver. This method is often referred to as Floortime; however, the Floortime component is only part of the approach.
