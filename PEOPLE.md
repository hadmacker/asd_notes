## Suspected or Observed Diagnosis (Not formally diagnosed)

In the book "The Autistic Mind" (Grandin) explains the history of Autism and how diagnosis has evolved from 1943 (Leo Kanner) to preset time (DSM-5, 2013) as the understanding of the condition has changed. It is believed that the individuals on this list _may_ qualify for an Autism diagnosis based on the current understanding of the condition.

Individuals should research these people independently. A search engine query for "Did _name_ have autism?" will result in apocryphal observations justifying a diagnosis using the current understanding of the condition.
