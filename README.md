## Suspected or Observed Diagnosis (Not formally diagnosed)

In the book "The Autistic Mind" (Grandin) explains the history of Autism and how diagnosis has evolved from 1943 (Leo Kanner) to preset time (DSM-5, 2013) as the understanding of the condition has changed. It is believed that the individuals on this list may qualify for an Autism diagnosis based on the current understanding of the condition.

Individuals should research these people independently. A search engine query for "Did _name_ have autism?" will result in apocryphal observations justifying a diagnosis using the current understanding of the condition.

### Interventions

* **Developmental Individual Difference Relation-Based Intervention (DIR)**
  * Developed by Stanley Greenspan and Serena Wieder, approach autism from a developmental point of view rather than as a behavioral issue. DIR is a less-structured model for behavioral intervention, focusing on strengthening and then building upon the emotional bond of the child with his or her caregiver. This method is often referred to as Floortime; however, the Floortime component is only part of the approach.

Yet today, he argued, it is increasingly a worker’s greatest skill, not his average skill level, that matters. As capitalism has grown more adept at disaggregating tasks, workers can focus on what they do best, and managers are challenged to make room for brilliant, if difficult, outliers.

## How to disclose an Autism diagnosis to child

The following process from [Dr. Stephen Shore](https://drstephenshore.com/) is described further in [Uniquely Human](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/23492643) Chapter 12

* Dr. Stephen Shore's 4 step process:
  * Step 1: Make the child aware of their distinct personal strengths.
  * Step 2: Develop a list of their strengths and challenges
  * Step 3: Without judgment, discuss and compare the child's strengths and challenges of role models, friends, and loved ones.
  * Step 4: Explain how the child's strengths and challenges lead to the diagnosis of Autism.

## Myths and Misconceptions

* [Dispelling Common Myths about Autism](https://www.adventisthealth.org/blog/2019/april/dispelling-common-myths-about-autism)

### Myth: Autism is caused by bad parenting or neglect.

This myth is based on a theory that was debunked a long time ago. Sadly, it wrongly attributed autism to some mothers’ alleged lack of emotional warmth. No one knows exactly what causes autism. But scientists think genetics play the biggest role.


### Myth: People with autism lack empathy.

GPT: Actually, people with autism can experience and express empathy in their own unique ways. They may struggle with understanding social cues and nonverbal communication, but this does not mean they are incapable of empathy.


### Myth: Autism is a mental illness.

> Autism is not an illness and there is no cure.  
> [nhs.uk](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/autism/autism-and-everyday-life/treatments-that-are-not-recommended-for-autism/)


### Myth: Autism can be cured.

> Autism is not an illness and there is no cure.  
> [nhs.uk](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/autism/autism-and-everyday-life/treatments-that-are-not-recommended-for-autism/)

Research-backed interventions and therapies exist that may help autistic individuals to develop life skills and manage harmful behaviours.

:warning: Some treatments and approaches may be harmful, fake, or unsupported by research. Further investigation should be performed prior to adopting any such treatment.


### Myth: Autism only affects boys.

ASD is more than 4 times more common among boys than among girls.
