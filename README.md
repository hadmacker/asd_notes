## Suspected or Observed Diagnosis (Not formally diagnosed)

Do your own research here. A search engine query for "Did <person> have autism?" will result in some interesting search results. The book "The Autistic Mind" (Grandin) explains the history of Autism and how diagnosis has evolved from 1943 (Leo Kanner) to preset time (DSM-5, 2013) as the understanding of the condition has changed. It is believed that many of the individuals on this list might have an Autism diagnosis based on the current understanding of the condition.

* Nikola Tesla
  * A/C Electricity, A/C Motor, Radio-controlled robots
* Albert Einstein
  * Theoretical Physics, Nuclear physics, Atomic Bomb research
* Mozart
  * [Did Mozart have Autism](https://www.crossrivertherapy.com/autism/did-mozart-have-autism)
  * Child Prodigy, perfect musical memory, ability to read music
