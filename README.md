## Suspected or Observed Diagnosis (Not formally diagnosed)

In the book "The Autistic Mind" (Grandin) explains the history of Autism and how diagnosis has evolved from 1943 (Leo Kanner) to preset time (DSM-5, 2013) as the understanding of the condition has changed. It is believed that the individuals on this list may qualify for an Autism diagnosis based on the current understanding of the condition.

Individuals should research these people independently. A search engine query for "Did _name_ have autism?" will result in apocryphal observations justifying a diagnosis using the current understanding of the condition.

# Tactful Responses to Interactions, Myths & Challenging Questions or Comments

Several questions below were copied from the table of contents of [Understanding Autism for Dummies](https://www.perlego.com/book/1010137/understanding-autism-for-dummies-pdf) although this book has not been reviewed for answers.

:warning: Several answers below are marked "GPT" and were provided verbatim from ChatGPT. Individuals should review these for correctness and clarity.

## Briefly:

* :star: "Let's pause this. He/she needs my immediate attention."
* "His/her behaviour comes from a difference in how their brain is wired."
* "My child is autistic (or has autism). That's why they do that."
* "Their meltdown is a response to unique sensory and emotional processing, and is not a manipulation or faulty parenting."

## Showing signs of impending meltdown or event

> Let's pause this. He/she needs my immediate attention.

or...

> Excuse me, he/she is attempting to communicate and needs my full attention.


## Will he/she grow out of it?

```
GPT: Autism is a lifelong neurodevelopmental condition, which means that it does not go away or disappear over time. However, with the right support and interventions, individuals with autism can learn to navigate the world more effectively and develop skills and abilities that will help them to thrive. It's important to focus on supporting individuals with autism rather than trying to "cure" or "fix" them, as they are valuable members of our society who deserve respect and understanding. By providing the right support and accommodations, we can help individuals with autism achieve their full potential and contribute to society in meaningful ways.

```

## What special talent does he/she have?

```
GPT: Every person, regardless of whether they have a disability or not, is unique and has their own strengths and challenges. Instead of focusing on any perceived special talents or abilities, it's important to appreciate and respect individuals with autism for who they are as a whole person. I believe that every individual has something valuable to contribute, and it's important to focus on their abilities rather than their disabilities.

```

## Why can't you control your child?

```
GPT: Meltdowns are a common experience for many individuals with autism, and they can be very overwhelming and challenging to manage. It's important to understand that meltdowns are not a result of poor parenting or a lack of discipline, but rather a manifestation of the individual's unique sensory and emotional processing. Just like everyone else, individuals with autism have good days and bad days, and they may struggle to regulate their emotions and behavior during times of stress or overwhelm. Instead of blaming the individual or their family, it's important to offer understanding and support to help them navigate these difficult moments.

```

Also

```
GPT: I understand that my child's behavior may appear disruptive or challenging to manage, but I want to assure you that I am doing my best to support them in this moment. Autism is a complex neurological condition that can make it challenging for individuals to regulate their emotions and behavior, especially during times of stress or overwhelm. As a parent, my top priority is to ensure the safety and well-being of my child, and I am doing everything I can to help them manage this situation. I would appreciate your understanding and support, rather than judgment or criticism, as we work through this together. Thank you.

```

## Why should your kid get special treatment?

```
GPT: I understand that my child's behavior may appear disruptive or challenging to manage, but I want to assure you that I am doing my best to support them in this moment. Autism is a complex neurological condition that can make it challenging for individuals to regulate their emotions and behavior, especially during times of stress or overwhelm. As a parent, my top priority is to ensure the safety and well-being of my child, and I am doing everything I can to help them manage this situation. I would appreciate your understanding and support, rather than judgment or criticism, as we work through this together. Thank you.

```

## Are you kidnapping that kid?

```
GPT: I understand that it may look unusual to see someone working closely with a child with autism, but we are not kidnapping anyone. We are working together to support the child's needs and help them develop skills and abilities that will enable them to navigate the world more effectively. Autism is a neurological condition that can make it challenging for individuals to communicate and interact with others, but with the right support and interventions, individuals with autism can lead fulfilling and meaningful lives. Instead of making assumptions or jumping to conclusions, it's important to approach situations like this with empathy and understanding.

```

## The "bad parent" glance

I would appreciate your understanding and support, rather than judgment or criticism, as we work through this together. Thank you.

```

## They don't look autistic

```
GPT: Autism is a neurological condition that affects individuals in different ways, and there is no one-size-fits-all presentation of autism. Some individuals with autism may have more visible symptoms, while others may not show any outward signs at all. It's important to understand that every individual with autism is unique, and that the condition can manifest in a variety of ways. Just because someone doesn't fit the stereotypical image of autism doesn't mean that they don't have the condition or that they don't face unique challenges. Instead of making assumptions based on appearance, it's important to approach each individual with empathy and understanding, and to appreciate them for who they are as a whole person.

## How to disclose an Autism diagnosis to child

The following process from [Dr. Stephen Shore](https://drstephenshore.com/) is described further in [Uniquely Human](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/23492643) Chapter 12

* Stephen Shore's 4 step process:
  * Step 1: Make the child aware of their distinct personal strengths.
  * Step 2: Develop a list of their strengths and challenges
  * Step 3: Without judgment, discuss and compare the child's strengths and challenges of role models, friends, and loved ones.
  * Step 4: Explain how the child's strengths and challenges lead to the diagnosis of Autism.

## Myths and Misconceptions

### Myth: Autism is caused by bad parenting or neglect.

```
GPT: The notion that autism is caused by bad parenting or neglect is a harmful myth that has been debunked by scientific evidence. There is no evidence to support the idea that parents are responsible for causing autism in their children. Instead, research suggests that autism is primarily caused by genetic factors.

Numerous studies have investigated the causes of autism, and none have found any evidence to support the idea that bad parenting or neglect plays a role. In fact, research has consistently shown that autism is a highly heritable condition, meaning that it is largely influenced by genetics. For example, a 2019 study published in the journal Nature Genetics found that genetic factors accounted for around 80% of the risk of developing autism.

Moreover, research has shown that parental behavior has little to no impact on the likelihood of a child developing autism. A 2015 study published in the Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders found that parenting behavior did not differ between parents of children with autism and parents of typically developing children. Another study published in the same journal in 2019 found no association between early parenting behavior and the risk of developing autism.

In summary, the idea that bad parenting or neglect causes autism is a myth that has been debunked by scientific evidence. Autism is a complex neurodevelopmental condition that is primarily caused by genetic factors, and parental behavior has little to no impact on the likelihood of a child developing autism. It is important to dispel these harmful myths and focus on providing support and understanding to individuals with autism and their families.

### Myth: People with autism lack empathy.

```
GPT: Actually, people with autism can experience and express empathy in their own unique ways. They may struggle with understanding social cues and nonverbal communication, but this does not mean they are incapable of empathy.
```

### Myth: Autism is a mental illness.

> Autism is not an illness and there is no cure.  
> [nhs.uk](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/autism/autism-and-everyday-life/treatments-that-are-not-recommended-for-autism/)

### Myth: Autism can be cured.

> Autism is not an illness and there is no cure.  
> [nhs.uk](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/autism/autism-and-everyday-life/treatments-that-are-not-recommended-for-autism/)

Research-backed interventions and therapies exist that may help autistic individuals to develop life skills and manage harmful behaviours.

:warning: Some treatments and approaches may be harmful, fake, or unsupported by research. Further investigation should be performed prior to adopting any such treatment.


### Myth: Autism only affects boys.

ASD is more than 4 times more common among boys than among girls.
