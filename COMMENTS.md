## Will he/she grow out of it?

> One does't outgrow autism. It grows with them.


## What special talent does he/she have?

> Some autistic children have special talents and some don't, just like the rest of us. What's _your_ special talent?  
> From:[Understanding Autism for Dummies](https://www.perlego.com/book/1010137/understanding-autism-for-dummies-pdf)


## Why can't you control your child? (Meltdowns)

Quick Responses:
* Thanks for your concern – we have it covered!
* They’re focused on developing other skills right now.
* We’re working with someone to help them grow in that area.
* They're all out of calm, so I’m helping give them calm.
* They're not giving me a hard time, they're having a hard time.

This question often comes up in response to meltdowns in public settings. Meltdowns should not be misinterpreted as a tantrum, although they may manifest with similar behaviours. Meltdowns are a neurological defense response to being overstimulated, it is not under their control any more than closing your eyes when sneezing is. This is in comparison to a Tantrum, which is deliberate, attention-seeking behaviour driven by a frustration response or desire to manipulate a situation. 

A meltdown is a response to unique sensory and emotional processing and is not a manipulation or faulty parenting.

## Why should your kid get special treatment?

> A child with autism should get what they need because they need it. Simple as that.  
> From: [Understanding Autism for Dummies](https://www.perlego.com/book/1010137/understanding-autism-for-dummies-pdf)


## They don't look autistic

> Autism is a neurological condition that affects individuals in different ways, and there is no one-size-fits-all presentation of autism.


## Isn’t everyone a little autistic?

* Everyone gets short of breath sometimes, but not everyone has asthma.
* Just because your blood sugar is impacted by what you eat, this doesn't mean everyone's a little diabetic.

## I’m so sorry for you.

There is no need to feel sorry; autism is a physical difference in the brain with its own strengths and challenges. We embrace their unique perspective and abilities. Understanding and support mean more than sympathy.

> You didn't lose a child to autism. You lost a child because the child you waited for never came into existence. That isn't the fault of the autistic child who does exist, and it shouldn't be our burden. We need and deserve families who can see us and value us for ourselves, not families whose vision of us is obscured by the ghosts of children who never lived. Grieve if you must, for your own lost dreams. But don't mourn for us. We are alive. We are real.  
> Jim Sinclair, "Don't Mourn for Us", Our Voice, Vol. 1, No. 3, 1993 Wiki: Jim Sinclair (Activist)  

## Is there a cure? Are you looking for a cure? Can I pray for a cure?

Autism is a physical difference in how the brain is wired. It is not a disease to be cured. Efforts should focus on acceptance, understanding, and supporting diverse ways of experiencing the world rather than seeking a cure.

Praying for a cure is unnecessary and is a sensitive topic. Please check out this amazing book prior to continuing this path of thought.

[Autism and The Church: Bible, Theology, and Community, Author: Grant Macaskill](https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/themelios/review/autism-and-the-church/)

Individuals with autism are not broken, damaged, faulty, sick, diseased, defective, or cursed. _They have value, unquestionably, without compromise, without change_. We must be mindful to _not assume_ that they are valued only if they are _cured_ or _conform_ to a normative set of typical behaviours.


# Myths and Misconceptions

* [Dispelling Common Myths about Autism](https://www.adventisthealth.org/blog/2019/april/dispelling-common-myths-about-autism)

### Myth: Autism is caused by bad parenting or neglect.

This myth is based on a theory that was debunked a long time ago. Sadly, it wrongly attributed autism to some mothers’ alleged lack of emotional warmth. No one knows exactly what causes autism. But scientists think genetics play the biggest role.


### Myth: People with autism lack empathy.

##### [This section has been augmented with the use of AI](AI.md)

Actually, people with autism can experience and express empathy in their own unique ways. They may struggle with understanding social cues and nonverbal communication, but this does not mean they are incapable of empathy.


### Myth: Autism is a mental illness.

> Autism is not an illness and there is no cure.  
> [nhs.uk](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/autism/autism-and-everyday-life/treatments-that-are-not-recommended-for-autism/)


### Myth: Autism can be cured. 

> Autism is not an illness and there is no cure.  
> [nhs.uk](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/autism/autism-and-everyday-life/treatments-that-are-not-recommended-for-autism/)

Individuals with autism are not broken, damaged, faulty, sick, diseased, defective, or cursed. _They have value, unquestionably, without compromise, without change_. We must be mindful to _not assume_ that they are valued only if they are _cured_ or _conform_ to a normative set of typical behaviours.


### Myth: Autism only affects boys.

ASD is more than 4 times more common among boys than among girls.
