# Myths and Misconceptions

* [Dispelling Common Myths about Autism](https://www.adventisthealth.org/blog/2019/april/dispelling-common-myths-about-autism)

### Myth: Autism is caused by bad parenting or neglect.

This myth is based on a theory that was debunked a long time ago. Sadly, it wrongly attributed autism to some mothers’ alleged lack of emotional warmth. No one knows exactly what causes autism. But scientists think genetics play the biggest role.


### Myth: People with autism lack empathy.

GPT: Actually, people with autism can experience and express empathy in their own unique ways. They may struggle with understanding social cues and nonverbal communication, but this does not mean they are incapable of empathy.


### Myth: Autism is a mental illness.

> Autism is not an illness and there is no cure.  
> [nhs.uk](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/autism/autism-and-everyday-life/treatments-that-are-not-recommended-for-autism/)


### Myth: Autism can be cured.

> Autism is not an illness and there is no cure.  
> [nhs.uk](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/autism/autism-and-everyday-life/treatments-that-are-not-recommended-for-autism/)

Research-backed interventions and therapies exist that may help autistic individuals to develop life skills and manage harmful behaviours.

:warning: Some treatments and approaches may be harmful, fake, or unsupported by research. Further investigation should be performed prior to adopting any such treatment.


### Myth: Autism only affects boys.

ASD is more than 4 times more common among boys than among girls.
